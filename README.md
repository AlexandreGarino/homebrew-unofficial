# Homebrew Unofficial

This repository contains Caskfiles whose download binary is behind a registration wall.

# Usage

After you have installed `homebrew-cask`, add this tap to the list of your `homebrew` tap sources:
```
brew tap AlexandreGarino/homebrew-unofficial
```

You now have access to install casks from here just as you would from the official project:
```
brew cask install vmware-ovf-tool
```
